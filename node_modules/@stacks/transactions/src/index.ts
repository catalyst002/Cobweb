/**
 * ### `Pc.` Post Condition Builder
 * @beta Interface may be subject to change in future releases.
 *
 * The Pc namespace is provided as a convenience to build post conditions.
 * The pattern chains methods together to build a post condition.
 * `PRINCIPAL -> [AMOUNT] -> CODE -> ASSET`
 *
 * The builder starts with the {@link Pc.principal} method.
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * import { Pc } from '@stacks/transactions';
 * Pc.principal('STB44HYPYAT2BB2QE513NSP81HTMYWBJP02HPGK6').willSendEq(10000).ustx();
 * ```
